      <h2 class="w3-center">What is homeostasis?</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Homeostasis is the ability to maintain <b>balance</b> within an organism. In other words, it is the ability of an 
        organism to maintain a <b>stable</b> internal environment, despite changes to its internal or external environment. Homeostasis is the maintenance of <b>equilibrium</b> (balance). Life is dependent 
        on this balance in order to survive. Otherwise, organisms would be unsuitable for life.</p>

      <p class="w3-large"><b>Think of it this way:</b> when you see a ball flying towards you, your instant reflex is to move away. That is 
        homeostasis at work. Homeostasis is what is keeping you alive. The nervous system receives information from the eyes and sends 
        messages to the joints and limbs to move away from potential harm.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">
          This is done through the processes of <b>feedback pathways</b>. Feedback pathways are pathways that the body can take when experiencing a certain <b>stimulus</b> (driving force or factor). There are two pathways the body may take: <b>negative feedback pathway</b> and <b>positive feedback pathway</b>. Negative feedback is the more common form. An example of it would be maintaining internal body temperature. When the body is too hot, the body will try to lower its temperature until it reaches the optimal range. The main goal of it is to stabilize the body back to its original state. On the other hand, positive feedback works in <b>opposite</b> to negative feedback. One example of it would be giving brith to a baby. Contractions of the uterus causes <b>hormones</b> (chemical signals) to be released to cause further contractions until the baby is released. 
          </p>

        <p class="w3-large">
         Both negative feedback and positive feedback are important in maintaining homeostasis because they help the body reach a balanced state efficiently. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Nervous System</h1>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-large">One important system that regulates homeostasis is the <b>nervous system</b>. The nervous system acts as a <b>central coordinating system</b>, sending 
        and receiving signals to make decisions based on what is happening to the body. The nervous system consists of two parts: the central nervous 
        system and the peripheral nervous system. 
        </p>

      <p class="w3-large">The <b>central nervous system (CNS)</b> consists of the <b>brain</b> and <b>spinal cord</b>. This can be thought of as the main office of the company. 
        The brain is where decisions are made and sent out, while the spinal cord can be thought of as the main hall leading to the office. On its way to and from 
        the office, there are many doors that lead to separate rooms and workplaces. These rooms and workplaces can be thought of as the <b>peripheral nervous 
        system (PNS)</b>. The peripheral nervous systems works with the central nervous system to get work done. It receives and sends signals to the brain, similar 
        to how workers in a company receive orders from the head and report back. The main function of the PNS is to <b>connect</b> the CNS to the limbs, organs and skin. 
      </p>  

      <p class="w3-large">Together, the nervous system works to maintain balance within the body based on external or internal factors. These factors can include 
        a change in surrounding temperature, physical harm and potential threats. 
      </p>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Central Nervous System</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-large">The CNS consist of two vital organs: the <b>brain</b> and <b>spinal cord</b>. The brain is the main coordinating system and plays a crucial 
          role in controlling most of the bodily functions such asÂ movements, sensations, thoughts, speech, and memory.
        </p>


        <img src="images/central nervous system.gif" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Central Nervous System" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="80" style="width:55%">

        <br>

        <p class="w3-large" align="right"> The spinal cord connects a part of the brain called the <b>brainstem</b> and runs through the <b>spinal canal</b>. It acts as a pathway between 
          the brain and peripheral nervous system to carry signals back and forth.
        </p>
      
        <p class="w3-large" align="right">The <b>cerebrum</b> is the largest part of the brain. It is responsible for controlling <b>voluntary actions</b> such as speech, senses, thought and memory. The cerebrum can be 
          further divided into two halves: the <b>right</b> and <b>left hemispheres</b>.
        </p>


        <p class="w3-large" align="right">Each hemisphere divides into four regions called <b>lobes</b>. These include: 
            <br>
            <br>  
        
        
          <b>Frontal lobes</b> - Located in the front of the brain and they are responsible for skills such as voluntary movement, speech output and organizational skills.
          
          <img src="Images/brain diagram.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Brain Diagram" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="60" style="width: 100;">
          <br>

          <br>
          <p class="w3-large" align="right"> <b>Parietal lobes</b> - Located behind the frontal lobes and they process sensory information. This information can include temperature, taste and touch. 
          </p>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right"><b>Temporal lobes</b> - Located on each side of the brain and are responsible for processing memory as well as processing auditory information from hearing. 
          </p>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right"><b>Occipital lobes</b> - Located at the back of the brain and are responsible for processing or receiving visual information from sight. 
          </p>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right">Another very important structure of the brain is the <b>cerebellum</b>. It is located near the brainstem which is the area connecting the brain to the spinal cord. The cerebellum is responsible for many functions including motor skills such as coordination, balance and posture. 
          </p>

          <img src="Images/brain diagram pt. 2.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Another Brain Diagram" align="left" hspace="40" vspace="60" style="width: 55%;">

             <br>
             <br>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right">The <b>hypothalamus</b> is a small region located near the base of the brain. It plays a crucial role in regulating <b>automatic functions</b> including thirst, appetite and body temperature (Fernando, 2020). It also plays an important role in working with other body systems to maintain homeostasis (which will be discussed later). It secretes hormones based on different internal or environmental influences such as puberty. 

            <br>
            <b>Hormones</b> are chemical signals that are capable of activating certain functions when received by specific organs. 

          </p>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right">The <b>pituitary gland</b> is located under the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. It is responsible for producing hormones that are capable of controlling many functions which are processed by the <b>endocrine system</b> (another body system; responsible for regulating hormones). The pituitary gland regulates the production of hormones and works with the endocrine system to accomplish balance. </p>

        <p class="w3-large">The <b>PNS</b> is the other division of the nervous system that consists of all the <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/nerves/" target="_blank">nerves</a> found outside the <b>CNS</b>. The main role of it is to connect the CNS to all organs, limbs and skin (Cherry, 2020). Thus connecting the main system (CNS) to all other parts of the body. The PNS can be divided into two parts:
          <br><br>

          <b>â¢ Somatic Nervous System</b>
          <br>
          <b>â¢ Autonomatic Nervous System</b>
          <br><br>
          First, let us define a few key structures. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Neuron/Nerve Cell</b> - A specialized cell within the body that works specifically for the nervous system. It uses <b>chemical</b> and <b>electrical signals</b> to communicate with other neurons/nerve cells in order for messages to be passed on to organs, tissues and the brain. In other words, it sends and receives messages. The term neuron is often used interchangeable with nerve cell. The signals passed between these cells are called <b>synapses.</b>

          <img src="Images/neuron.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Neuron" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="30" style="width: 40;">


          <img src="Images/neuron synapse.gif" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Neuron Synapse" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" style="width: 40;">
          

         </p>

         <br><br>

         <p class="w3-large" align="right">
          The diagram to the left illustrates the typical structure of a neuron. <b>Dendrites</b> are the extended branches reaching out from the cell body. Dendrites are specialized to receive chemical signals from other neurons. These chemical signals are converted into small <b>electrical impulses</b> and sent inward toward the <b>cell body</b>. The <b>nucleus</b> is found in the centre of the cell body and it stores the cellâs <b>genetic material</b> necessary for coding proteins. The <b>axon</b> is the long section that branches away from the cell body. Electrical impulses travel down this path and leave the neuron through the <b>axon terminal</b>. The <b>myelin sheath</b> wraps around the axon and protects the nerves from other electrical impulses. It also poses to transmit electrical impulses more <b>quickly</b> and <b>efficiently</b>. <b>Schwann cells</b> are a type of <b>glial cell</b> (another type of cell that helps the nervous system) that help to form the myelin sheath. The <b>Nodes of Ranvier</b> are the gaps between the myelin sheath that <b>speedup action potentials</b>. </p>

          <br><br>

          <p class="w3-large" align="right">
            <b>What are action potentials?</b> Recall that the body contains many chemicals in the form of <b>charged molecules</b> (also known as ions). Likewise, electrical and chemical signals sent between neurons are just <b>temporary shifts</b> between positive and negative sides which we call action potentials. The outer membrane of a neuron is <b>semi-permeable</b>, meaning only some substances can enter. Thus allowing only certain ions to enter. Neurons are negatively charged when at <b>rest</b>, while the outside the neuron is more positive. When neurons receive chemical signals in the form of ions, there is a sudden flow of positive ions through the neuron. This causes the neuron to become more positive until the ions flow out of the neuron. The shift between positive and negative is referred to as an action potential and it is responsible for creating electrical impulses when ions enter the neuron. </p>
            
            <p class="w3-large">For a deeper view on neuron structure, have a look at this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2kuU2mZzeU" title="neuron structure" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">neuron structure</a></p>

            <br>

         <p class="w3-large"><b>Nerve</b> - Consists of bundles of neurons/nerve cells.<br><br>
            <b>Glial Cell</b> - Supports the activity of neurons. Glial cells nourish neurons, remove their wastes and defend against infection.

         <h3>Somatic Nervous System</h3>

         <p class="w3-large">The <b>somatic nervous system</b> carries sensory and motor information to and from the CNS. It transmits sensory information and <b>voluntary movement</b>. This allows us to have some voluntary control and awareness of what is happening (Cherry, 2020). Two major types of neurons are associated with this system.<br><br>

          â¢ <b>Motor neurons</b> - Carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibres throughout the body. These neurons allow for <b>physical action</b> against possible threats from the external environment. <br><br>

          â¢ <b>Sensory neurons</b> - Carry information from the nerves and to the central nervous system. These neurons allow for <b>sensory information</b> to be passed on to the spinal cord and brain. 

        </p><br><br>

         <h3>Autonomic Nervous System</h3>

         <p class="w3-large">The <b>autonomic nervous system</b> is responsible for regulating <b>involuntary body functions</b>. These include: blood flow, heartbeat, digestion and breathing. It controls functions that do not need to be consciously thought of (Cherry, 2020). Furthermore, it is divided into two branches:<br><br>

          â¢ <b>Sympathetic system</b> - Stimulates the fight-or-flight response. It is capable of triggering a response by increasing heart rate, breathing rate and boosting blood flow to muscles.<br><br>
          â¢ <b>Parasympathetic system</b> - Maintains the bodyâs normal functions. It slows heart rate, slows breathing and reduces blood flow to the muscles.  <br><br>
          Together, the sympathetic and parasympathetic system can be thought of as <b>switches</b>; both balance each other.

        </p>

    <div class="w3-col 25 w3-padding-large">
      <h1 class="w3-center">Other Organ Systems</h1>

      <p class="w3-large">The nervous system works with various other organ systems to maintain homeostasis and perform their function.<br> The ones we will cover are:<br><br>
        <b>â¢ Endocrine System</b> - Produces and secretes hormones to influenece bodily functions. Some organs in this system inlcude: pancreas, hypothalamus, testes, ovaries and pituitary gland.<br><br>
        <b>â¢ Circulatory System</b> - Provides circulation which makes inhaling and exhaling possible for breathing. Some organs/fluids in this system include: blood, veins, arteries and heart. <br><br>
        <b>â¢ Excretory System</b> - Disposes wastes that would otherwise be harmful to the body. Some organs in this system include: kidneys, bladder, large intestine and liver.  <br><br>
        <b>â¢ Digestive System</b> - Breaks down food in order for energy to be attained. Some organs in this system include: stomach, mouth, esophagus and intestines.<br><br>
      </p>

      <img src="Images/teamwork.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="teamwork" style="width: 80%;">

      <br><br><br>

      <h2>Nervous System and Endocrine System</h2>

      <p class="w3-large">The <b>nervous system</b> and <b>endocrine system</b> work together and play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis. The <b>hypothalamus</b> (part of the brain) releases <b>hormones</b> after receiving signals of a change or inbalance. These hormones eventually reach the <b>pituitary gland</b> (part of the nervous system and endocrine system). In the response to these hormones, the pituitary gland then secretes its own hormones which are picked up by <b>target organs</b>. The organs receive these hormones and undergo a certain function as a result. In short, the hypothalamus recieves signals from the nervous system and sends messages (in the form of hormones) to the pituitary gland to release its own hormones in response. 
      </p>

      <img src="Images/nervous system and endocrine system.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Nervous System and Endocrine System" align="left" hspace="40" vspace="50" style="width: 55%;">

      <p class="w3-large" align="right">One example is the use of hormones to influence <b>blood sugar levels</b>.<br> When sugar levels are high in the blood, a hormone called <b>insulin</b> is released, whereas a hormone called <b>glucagon</b> is released when the sugar levels are low. The hypothalamus receives signals from the nervous system
      that notify it that sugar levels are either too high or too low. This causes it to release hormones which trigger the pituitary gland to secrete its own hormones. The hormones from the pituitary gland cause the <b>pancreas </b> to release insulin or glucagon in response to it. These two hormones then regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.<br><br>
      Another example is the role of hormones in <b>puberty</b>. Once again, the hypothalamus receives signals from the nervous system and lets it know when it is time for puberty. This causes the hypothalamus to secrete a hormone called <b>gonadotropin (GnRH)</b>. GnRH causes the pituitary gland to secrete hormones <b>LH</b> and <b>FSH</b>. These hormones are present in both males and females. The only difference is the amount present. In males, more LH is present and it encourages the production of <b>testosterone</b>. For females, more FSH is present and it encourages the production of <b>estrogen</b>. Both testosterone and estrogen act as hormones to influence the <b>development</b> of further growth characteristics. 
     </p>
     
     <br><br><br><br>

     <h2>Nervous System and Circulatory System</h2>

     <img src="Images/circulatory system.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Circulatory System" align="right" hspace="50" style="width: 40%;">

     <p class="w3-large">The <b>nervous system</b> and <b>circulatory system</b> complement each other in their work and function. Just like all cells in the body, neurons or glial cells require <b>oxygen</b> to release energy. The presence of oxygen is crucial for cells to get the energy they need to function. Otherwise, they would not be able to perform their duties to support the body. The circulatory system helps the nervous system cells and all other cells to get the oxygen needed to perform functions. The blood <b>circulates</b> to all parts of the body where cells need oxygen.<br><br>
      In turn, the nervous system monitors <b>blood pressure</b> and <b>heart rate</b>. The blood must sustain a certain level of pressure in order for <b>glucose</b> (sugar) in the blood to be efficiently reabsorbed though the <b>kidneys</b> (we will touch on this shortly). Inability to reabsorb glucose results in a <b>loss</b> of nutrients. As for heart rate, the nervous system lowers and raises heart rate in response to certain <b>stimuli</b> (factors). For instance, a dangerous or stressful situation can cause the brain to increase heart rate. This would increase the rate of blood flowing around the body as a defence mechanism to get more oxygen to cells so they can produce more energy. Higher energy production would act as a defence against possible threats to the body such as physical harm. 

    </p><br><br><br><br><br>



    <h2>Nervous System and Excretory System</h2>

    <p class="w3-large" align="left">The <b>excretory system</b> is also commonly referred to as the <b>urinary system</b>. The nervous system and excretory system work together to <b>dispose</b> harmful wastes from the body. When the time is right, the <b>bladder</b> sends signals to the brain letting it know that it is time for disposal. The brain then controls the process of <b>urination</b> by sending signals to bladder muscles to release their grip and lighten. This causes urine to leave the bladder and exit the body through the <b>urethra</b>. However, before this can happen, the urine must be <b>filtered</b> in order for nutrients and water to be reabsorbed before it can leave the body as urine. This is where the kidneys come into play. <b>Waste</b> is filtered through the kidneys to <b>reabsorb</b> any remaining glucose or excess water to maximize the nutrients gained. After this, the urine can be stored in the bladder, awaiting the right time to be released.<br><br>

     
    <img src="Images/urinary tract.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Urinary Tract" align="right" style="width: 55%;"> <br>

      What does this have to do with homeostasis? Well, waste products are <b>toxic</b> and and can harm the body. In many organisms, waste comes in the form of urine, which contains a level of highly acidic <b>uric acid</b>. This is harmful to the body and strays it from balance if not dealt with.   However, this balance is maintained through homeostasis by nervous system and endocrine system regulation. They work together to dispose harmful substances. 
 
    </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



    <h2>Nervous System and Digestive System</h2>

    <img src="Images/digestive system.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Digestive System" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" style="width: 50%;">

    <p class="w3-large">The <b>nervous system</b> and <b>digestive system</b> work in turn to process digestion and maintain neural functions. Digestion provides neural cells with the energy needed for function. Food is broken down into smaller units of <b>glucose</b>. It can be absorbed by neural cells which lets them perform their regular functions such as sending signals. All cells need energy to perform functions for supporting the body. <br><br>
      Furthermore, the nervous system controls involuntary body functions which include <b>digestion</b>. The <b>autonomic nervous system</b> (part of the peripheral nervous system) is responsible for regulating these involuntary actions. The muscles and churning of the stomach are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The brain controls feeding behaviours and perception of appetite. Sensory information from the digestive system is sent to the nervous system for decisions to be made. For instance, when the stomach is empty and needs food to break down for cells, signals are sent to the brain to notify it to find a meal.<br><br>
      Another example is when sensory cells in the eyes see something that looks edible. These signals are sent to the brain which sends signals to the <b>salivary glands</b> to release <b>saliva</b> in the mouth. Saliva is produced in response to possible consumption of food. Use of saliva is part of the first stage of digestion.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Homeostasis Maintenance</h1>

      
      <p class="w3-large" align="left">The nervous system is crucially active in maintaining homeostasis. Many everyday or occasional events are influenced by the response of the nervous system. These can include more obvious performances such as reflexes, but can also include more subtle ones as well.<br> Here are some that the nervous system covers:

        <img src="Images/maintaining homeostasis.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Maintaining Homeostasis" align="right" hspace ="20" vspace="20" style="width: 50%;">

    <h2>Reflexes</h2>

    <img src="Images/nerves and organs in nervous system.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Nerves and Organs in Nervous System" align="right" hspace ="20" vspace="20" style="width: 50%;">

    <p class="w3-large"><b>Reflexes</b> are regulated by simple connections called <b>reflex arcs</b>. <b>Picture this:</b> you are walking by a stove and your arm accidentally brushes over it. Your first instinct is to move your arm away. Why is this?<br><br>
      Reflex arcs are activated when we experience sudden <b>danger</b>. This allows us to respond to the situation in the form of reflexes. Reflexes are <b>involuntary actions</b> that would otherwise take too long for the voluntary portion of the brain to process. A reflex arc moves <b>directly</b> to and from the brain or spinal cord before the voluntary portion of the brain can even process this sensory information. The voluntary portion of the brain processes the information after/during the reflex which is why your first instinct is to move away. Typically, there are only three types of neurons that are involved in this process:<br><br>

      â¢ <b>Sensory neurons</b> - Senses a potentially harmful stimulus (factor).<br>
      â¢ <b>Interneurons</b> - Activated by sensory neurons in the spinal cord. <br>
      â¢ <b>Motor neurons</b> - Instructs muscles to withdraw or evaluate from the harmful stimulus.

    </p>

    <p class="w3-large">Sensory neurons sense certain <b>changes</b> and <b>stimuli</b>, then send signals to interneurons in the spinal cord. Interneurons form a <b>bridge</b> between the central nervous system and the sensory neurons. However, before the messages can be processed by the brain, motor neurons receive response from the spinal cord to perform a reflex action. The brain fully processes the information after/during the reflex. </p>

    <p class="w3-large">
      Reflexes allow organisms to move away from potential danger without receiving messages directly from the voluntary portion of the brain which would otherwise take too long. The time it takes for a message to be received and sent via the brain may <b>delay</b> the bodyâs response by a given amount of time. This would increase the chance of <b>damage</b> to the body. Delayed reactions hinder the bodyâs response and tend away from homeostasis. Thus reflexes support homeostasis by decreasing the time needed to perform a certain response and protecting the body in a more efficient way. </p>

    <h2>Blood Sugar Levels</h2>

    <p class="w3-large">In an earlier section, blood sugar levels were discussed briefly. Now let us dive into the heart of it. As you may have learned, the blood contains a varying level of <b>glucose</b> (sugar) found within it. The stomach breaks down food into this sugar and it is absorbed via the <b>blood stream</b>. The blood also <b>reabsorbs</b> this sugar from the kidneys or wherever reabsorption is possible. Thus influencing the amount of sugar in the blood. When we refer to sugar levels, we are referring to the amount of sugar found within an individualâs blood. A <b>normal range</b> is a specified by a considerate amount that would not cause harm to the body. </p>


    <img src="Images/glucose in the blood.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Glucose in Blood" align="right" hspace ="10" style="width: 50%;">


    <p class="w3-large">However, there are instances when the blood sugar level is too <b>high</b> or too <b>low</b>. Above the normal range is known as <b>hyperglycaemia</b> and below the healthy range is known as <b>hypoglycaemia</b>. This is where the nervous system comes into play. The <b>autonomic nervous system</b> (regulates involuntary actions) monitors the levels of sugar in the blood. When levels are too low, perhaps from exercising, the automatic nervous system signals the pancreas to secrete a hormone called <b>glucagon</b>. Glucagon is a hormone that encourages more glucose to be released into the blood.
    </p>


    <p class="w3-large" align="left">When the sugar level is too high, perhaps from digestion of food, the autonomic nervous system signals the pancreas to secrete another hormone called <b>insulin</b>. Insulin is a hormone that encourages less glucose to be in the blood. It makes it easier for cells to absorb and converts the sugar into a more storable molecule called <b>glycogen</b>. </p>

    <br><br>

    <img src="Images/glucose feedback.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Glucose Feedback" align="right" hspace ="20" style="width: 100%;">

    
    <p class="w3-large">Regulating blood glucose levels is an example of a <b>negative feedback loop</b>.<br>
      <b>Recall:</b> A negative feedback loop is a pathway taken when the body experiences an imbalance internally or externally and tries to immediately stabilize back to its original state. </p>

    <p class="w3-large" align="left"><b>Quick Note:</b> The pancreas is an organ in the body responsible for producing <b>enzymes</b> (speeds up chemical reactions) for digestion and producing <b>hormones</b> to maintain sugar levels. 
    </p>


    <p class="w3-large" align="left">High and low blood sugar levels could cause harm to the body through increased chance of a <b>heart attack</b> or <b>heart failure</b> and even <b>cancer</b>. High blood sugar level (hyperglycaemia) is especially dangerous for people with <b>diabetes</b> since they cannot lower it on their own. Therefore, high and low blood sugar level can cause harm to the body and be potentially life-threatening. The nervous system maintains homeostasis by regulating the levels of sugar so it remains in a healthy range. 
    </p>

    <h2>Emotions</h2>

    <p class="w3-large">The main parts of the nervous system that contributes to the nature of emotions is the <b>autonomic nervous system</b> and <b>hypothalamus.</b></p>

    <p class="w3-large">The hypothalamus regulates the autonomic nervous system which controls various processes and glands. These include: pulse, blood pressure, breathing and arousal to emotional circumstances. The hypothalamus is also involved in emotional processing. Possibly, the hypothalamus senses certain stimuli in the environment which causes it to react and signal the autonomic nervous system. 
    </p>

    <p class="w3-large"><b>Quick Refresher:</b> The autonomic nervous system is divided into two divisions - <b>sympathetic nervous system</b> and <b>parasympathetic nervous system</b>. 
    </p>

    <p class="w3-large">In response to hormones from the hypothalamus, the sympathetic nervous system causes <b>adrenal glands</b> to release a hormone called <b>adrenaline</b> (also referred to as epinephrine). This causes the <b>fight-or-flight response</b>. This response then increases blood flow to muscles and an increased heart rate. Increased blood flow and heart rate enables the body to move quickly and feel less pain if perceived as dangerous. Emotions of <b>anger</b> or <b>stress</b> are susceptible to this state. </p>

    <img src="Images/fight-or-flight response.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Fight-or-Flight Response" align="right" hspace ="20" style="width: 60%;">


    <p class="w3-large"><b>Here is an example:</b> When the body encounters a <b>stressful</b> situation (for example, a presentation), the <b>short-term stress response</b> may be activated. The hypothalamus in the brain receives messages and releases hormones in response. These hormones then reach the <b>adrenal medulla</b> (inside the adrenal glands) to signal them to release the hormone <b>adrenaline</b>. Adrenaline encourages the increase of <b>blood flow, heart rate, blood pressure</b> and <b>metabolism</b> (chemical reactions in the body). The main reason for this is to allow the body to have a <b>burst</b> of energy. The body may use this energy to protect itself from potential danger. However, in regards to stressful situations, this energy is translated into feelings of <b>restlessness</b> from the short-term stress response. The fight-or-flight response may be activated and thus may cause the body to try to flee from potential danger to protect itself.  </p>

    <p class="w3-large">On the other side, the parasympathetic nervous system functions when the body is at <b>rest</b>. It helps the body store energy and <b>decreases</b> blood flow to muscles. Thus giving the body a more <b>calmed</b> and <b>relaxed</b> state. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="w3-large">The figure below illustrates the amount of activity corresponding to each emotion. The <b>warmest colours</b> represent an increased activity while the <b>cooler colours</b> represent a decreased activity.</p>

    <img src="Images/map of emotions.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Map of Emotions" align="right" hspace ="40" vspace="30" style="width: 60%;">

    <p class="w3-large">The sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system work in <b>partnership</b> to maintain homeostasis by functioning like <b>switches</b>. When one division is functioning, the other is at rest and vice versa. For instance, the body may sense a particular stimulus that could harm the body so the nervous system may respond to it by increasing heart rate so feelings of <b>anger</b> can protect the body. The action itself is a <b>defence mechanism</b> to protect the body. On the contrary, when everything is normal, the nervous system has no need to maintain a high heart rate so it lowers it to be more <b>efficient</b> and use <b>less energy</b>. This action is mainly used to help the body <b>store</b> energy. Recent research has even shown that <b>sadness</b> may be portrayed by the nervous system as another defence mechanism. <b>Crying</b> has been suggested to release <b>oxytocin</b> and <b>endorphins</b> which are chemical messengers that the body may use to help relieve stress (Legg, 2020). The hypothalamus complements both divisions in maintaining homeostasis by regulating them based on surroundings.</p>

    <br><br><br>


    <h2>Body temperature</h2>

    <p class="w3-large">The nervous system is also responsible for regulating the <b>internal temperature</b> of the body. The average human has a body temperature between 37 degrees Celsius and 37.8 degrees Celsius.  However, if the the body temperature falls below 35 degrees Celsius, that is considered <b>hypothermia</b> (below the healthy range). This can can lead to <b>cardiac arrest</b>, <b>brain damage</b> or possibly <b>death</b>. If the body temperature rises above 42 degrees Celsius, that is considered <b>hyperthermia</b> (above healthy range). This can lead to brain damage and even death (Holland, 2017). 
    </p>

    <p class="w3-large">
      Several factors influence temperature change.<br> 
      For <b>raise</b> in temperature, it may include: fever, exercise and digestion.<br> 
      For <b>drop</b> in temperature, it may include: drug use and alcohol use
      </p>


      <img src="Images/body temperature regulation.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Body Temperature Regulation" align="right" hspace ="25" vspace="20" style="width: 55%;">


      <p class="w3-large">The hypothalamus senses changes in body temperature and sends signals to muscles, organs and glands to respond in various ways. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">When the body needs to <b>cool down:</b><br></p>

      <p class="w3-large">â¢ Sweating occurs, the hypothalamus sends signals to sweat glands to release sweat. Sweating cools the skin as it evaporates and helps lower internal temperature.<br>
        â¢ Blood vessels under skin get wider. Signals from the hypothalamus tell blood vessels to relax. This allows for more blood to flow to cooler spots and away from the inner body. Heat can be released as a result. 
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large">When the body needs to <b>warm up:</b></p>

      <p class="w3-large">â¢ Blood vessels under skin become narrower. The hypothalamus sends signals to blood vessels to constrict. This causes blood flow under the skin to decrease and retain more heat in the inner body.<br>
       â¢ Hormones are released to increase metabolism. The hypothalamus can send signals to the thyroid glands to produce hormones which will increase metabolism. More energy and heat is produced as a result. 
      
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large"><b>Dramatic change</b> in body temperature from the healthy range could put the body at risk for many <b>health concerns</b> and be <b>life-threatening</b>. Thus straying the body from homeostasis. The nervous system regulates the internal temperature of the body and keeps it in a healthy range to prevent homeostasis imbalance.</p>
      
      
      <br><br><br>

      <h2>Vision</h2>

      <img src="Images/neural vision.webp" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Neural Vision" align="right" hspace ="10" vspace="20" style="width: 60%;">

      <img src="Images/human eye.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Human Eye" align="right" hspace ="10" vspace="10" style="width: 60%;">

      <p class="w3-large">The nervous system plays a role in visual perception of images and maintaining homeostasis as well. In humans, nervous tissue called the <b>retina</b> covers the rear inside of the eye. This tissue contains millions of <b>light-detecting cells</b> that receive the optic information and transmits it to the brain through the <b>optic nerve</b> (Editors, 2018). This results in a visual picture. The <b>dilation</b> of the pupils is also controlled by the nervous system. Dilation of the pupils allows the eyes to optimize the right amount of light entering for the best vision. Thus getting a clear image. Nerves in the eyes send this sensory information to the brain so an image can be processed. </p>


      <p class="w3-large"><b>Here is a more detailed look:</b> Light enters the eyes through the <b>pupils</b>. It controls how much light enters by <b>dilating</b> in response to the amount of light available. Less light and the pupils dilate <b>larger</b>, more light and the pupils may dilate <b>smaller</b>. The shape of the lens is altered by muscles behind the <b>iris</b> so farther/near images can be brought into focus on the retina. The <b>retina</b> is located near the back of the eye and contains millions of <b>photoreceptors</b> that detect light. Since humans have two eyes, this allows us to have <b>binocular vision</b>. Basically, the ability to perceive an image using both eyes. Visual information from each eye is passed to the <b>optic nerve</b> to the <b>optic chiasm</b> where some nerve fibres cross over. This <b>cross over</b> allows both sides of the brain to receive signals from both eyes. As a result, the right side of the brain processes information from the left side of the scene while the left side of the brain processes information from the right side of the scene.</p>


      <p class="w3-large">There are two types of photoreceptors (specialized neurons) called <b>rods</b> and <b>cones</b>. Rods are sensitive to light and allow us to see in <b>dim light</b>, but they do not convey colour. On the other hand, cones are responsible for <b>colour</b> and <b>acute detail</b>. The human eye contains three types of cones: <b>red, blue</b> and <b>green</b>. Each one is sensitive to a different range of colours. Contrary to that, the human eye can detect <b>thousands</b> of colours since the sensitivities overlap. This overlap allows colours to appear in a variety of ways. </p>

      
      <p class="w3-large">The centre part of the retina where light is focused is called the <b>fovea</b>. The area around it is called the <b>macula</b> and it is critical for reading and driving. Death of photoreceptors in the macula can cause <b>blindness</b> because light in the area cannot be focused or detected. </p>


      <p class="w3-large">Management of vision allows humans and organisms to get a better perception of the world around them. Better vision allows organisms to detect potential threats. For example, humans can associate specific colours with certain meanings such as colourful berries that are poisonous. Therefore, better vision helps maintain homeostasis by having more consciousness to surroundings. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">For more information of how eyes work, check out this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcedXDN6a88" title="how eyes work" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">How Eyes Work</a></p>

      <br><br><br>


      <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
      <img src="Images/platypus.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Platypus" align="right" hspace ="20" style="width: 30%;">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Platypuses</b> and <b>sharks</b> have a sixth sense called <b>electroreception</b>. This allows them to detect weak naturally occuring <b>electrostatic fields</b> in the environment. Similar to how our other senses work, special cells near the shark's head and platypuse's bill sense electrostatic vibrations from the environment which are sent to the brain to get a perception of their surroundings. This sense may be used to catch prey or naviagte surroundings. In fact, only two lineages have been known to use electroreception (Hopkins, 2014). These include: <b>monotremes</b> (egg-laying mammals) and <b>teleosts</b> (a group of ray-finned fishes).</p>

  
      <br><br>


      <h2>Impact</h2>

      <img src="Images/impact.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Impact" align="right" hspace ="30" vspace="30" style="width: 50%;">

      <p class="w3-large">If the nervous system was unable to perform its role in maintaining homeostasis, the body would be unable to keep an organism <b>alive</b>. Think about it this way, the nervous system works with many other organ systems and collaborates with a number of organs. Without it, the body would not know how to function effectively. Other systems would not work efficiently and even cause many problems. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">
        On the internal level (inside the body), many problems would occur. The <b>bladder</b> (stores waste until it is released) would not know when to release urine (waste) and there could be a build-up of harmful chemicals as a result. Also, <b>heart regulation</b> could easily become abnormal and lead to <b>strokes</b> (reduced amount of blood to the brain) or <b>heart attacks</b> (insufficient oxygen reaches the heart). The nervous system would leave the other systems defenceless and out of control. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">
        On the external level, the nervous system is responsible for our senses. These include: <b>sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.</b> Essentially, the body would lose all of these senses. Thus making the organism unconscious to its surroundings. Without consciousness, an organism would basically have no perception of the world around them. This could be harmful on the external level. No perception would mean that an organism has no awareness of what is happening. Furthermore, life would be impossible.</p>  

      <p class="w3-large">On both levels, homeostasis would be <b>unsustainable</b>.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">As flawless as it may seem, the nervous system does have its own diseases associated with it. In nature many possibilities can occur and life is not perfect. For instance, certain mutations may deem an organism more suitable for a given environment as opposed to other individuals of the same species. Life is susceptible to <b>change</b>. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Now, what does this have to do with the nervous system? Well, the nervous system does not always run perfectly. Like mutations, the nervous system can experience certain factors that will impact its performance as a system. These factors may be <b>hereditary</b> or perhaps due to <b>lifestyle</b> and even a <b>combination</b> of the two.<br>
        Some diseases associated with the nervous system include:
      
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large"><b>â¢ Alzheimerâs disease</b><br>
        <b>â¢ Bellâs palsy</b><br>
        <b>â¢ Epilepsy</b><br> 
        <b>â¢ Parkinsonâs disease</b><br>
        <b>â¢ Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</b></p>

      <h2 align="right">Alzheimerâs Disease</h2>

      <p class="w3-large" align="right"><b>Alzheimerâs disease</b> is a type of irreversible <b>dementia</b> that affects a personâs thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday tasks. Dementia causes a gradual loss of memory, intellect, rational thought and social skills. In fact, Alzheimerâs disease is the <b>most common form</b> of dementia and affects over half of the population of people with dementia. </p>

      <img src="Images/alzheimer's disease.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Alzheimerâs disease" align="left" hspace ="20" vspace="20" style="width: 40%;">
  
      <p class="w3-large" align="right">There are <b>two</b> main types of Alzheimerâs diseases: Sporadic Alzheimerâs and Familial Alzheimerâs.</p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="right"><b>Sporadic Alzheimerâs</b> is most common and typically occurs over the age of 65.<br>

        <b>Familial Alzheimerâs</b> is hereditary, but a very rare genetic condition. Typically for people in their 40s to 50s. </p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="right">What causes this though? As you have learned, <b>neurons</b> communicate with each other by chemical signals and create connections among brain cells. This is how memory, thinking and behaving form. However, Alzheimerâs <b>disturbs</b> these chemicals and affects connections between brain cells. This leads to <b>memory loss</b> and <b>behavioural changes</b>.</p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="right">Alzheimerâs disease affects the nervous system in maintaining homeostasis as it interferes with chemical signals that are crucial for a certain reaction. Messages may be misinterpreted which could cause potential harm to the body. Defending the body may be more difficult and possibly life-threatening. Overall, homeostasis is affected. </p>

      <br><br><br>

      <h2 align="right">Bell's Palsy</h2>

      <img src="Images/bell's palsy.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Bellâs palsy" align="left" hspace ="50" vspace="40" style="width: 43%;">

      <p class="w3-large" align="left"><b>Bellâs palsy</b> is the sudden <b>paralysis (losing sense)</b> or <b>weakness</b> of one side of the face. Typically, it is caused by a <b> viral infection</b> which causes <b>inflammation</b> of the nerves controlling facial muscles. </p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="left">Some symptoms may include:</p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="left">
       <b>â¢ Difficulty smiling</b><br>
       <b>â¢ Drooling</b><br>
       <b>â¢ Drooping of one side of the mouth</b><br>
       <b>â¢ Difficulty eating or drinking</b><br>     
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="left">
        Usually, this disease is only temporary and people fully recover within a few months to half a year. Though a small portion of people do not fully recover. </p>

      <p class="w3-large" align="left"><b>Inflammation</b> from the infection affects the nerves controlling <b>facial muscles</b> which in turn affects the bodyâs control over one side of the face. It is perhaps not as dangerous as other diseases, though still impactful. Overall, the role of the nervous system in homeostasis is not affected too severely. However, homeostasis is still impacted since nerves in the area cannot perform their function and may affect other bodily functions such as consumption of food. </p>

       <br><br><br>

      <h2>Epilepsy</h2>

      <img src="Images/epilepsy.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Epilepsy" align="right" hspace ="30" vspace="40" style="width: 55%;">

      <p class="w3-large"><b>Epilepsy</b> is a long-term condition in which a person experiences repeated <b>seizures</b>. Seizures are caused when <b>electrical activity</b> in the brain is disrupted. Depending on the part of the brain involved, the symptoms of seizures can vary. These may include: <b>loss of consciousness</b> and <b>unusual feelings or behaviours</b>. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">It is important to note that epilepsy is not just one condition. <b>Many</b> conditions can lead to prolonged seizures. There are many known types of seizures such as <b>generalized seizures</b> which affect the whole brain and <b>focal seizures</b> which affect only part of the brain. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">In general, epilepsy can be caused by <b>damage</b> to the brain such as a head injury, stroke, brain diseases or even from <b>genetic factors</b>. Not much is known about the causes, however, it is known that oneâs <b>family history</b> can play a major role.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Epilepsy affects the nervous systemâs ability to maintain homeostasis because it leaves the body vulnerable when seizures occur. For example, a seizure may cause an individual to lose consciousness and accidentally trip. The signals sent within the brain are disrupted depending on which region is affected. This causes that region or the whole brain to lose control over the body for a given period.

      <br><br><br>

      <h2>Parkinsonâs Disease</h2>

      <br>

      <p class="w3-large"><b>Parkinsonâs disease</b> is a nervous system disorder that results when nerve cells in a specific region of the brain are damaged. This specific region produces the hormone <b>dopamine</b> which is a chemical that is vital for <b>smooth muscle control</b> and <b>movement</b>. Dopamine is a <b>neurotransmitter</b> (chemical messenger) found in the brain that helps neurons send signals. Parkinsonâs disease affects the region where dopamine is <b>produced</b>. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Typically, Parkinsonâs disease may occur in people over the age of 65, though it can vary. The symptoms of this disease include: balance problems, slowing of movement, stooped posture, muscle stiffness or shaking which usually begins in one arm/hand. </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Currently, there is no cure and doctors are not sure exactly what causes this. Perhaps it could be exposure to specific <b>toxins</b> or <b>hereditary</b> (though only a small portion of patients are shown to have this connection). </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Parkinsonâs disease affects the body's <b>dopamine levels</b>. Dopamine influences signals in the brain. Damage to that region would affect how dopamine is used and signals may be lost. Therefore, this would affect the nervous system's ability to maintain homeostasis because of signals that are unsuccessfully sent. Overall, the nervous system cannot maintain homeostasis because nerves in that region may be <b>unresponsive</b>. Thus interfering with an individualâs motor skills and putting them at risk of potential danger. <b>Unresponsive nerves</b> can result in loss or decreased ability to facilitate movement. </p>

      <h2>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</h2>

      <p class="w3-large">As you may recall, the <b>myelin sheath</b> is a structure that wraps around the <b>axon</b> of a neuron.</p>
  
      <p class="w3-large">Here is a brief video to provide a refresh on neuron structure.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsMjUvMXxpE" title="neuron structure refresh" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Neuron Refresh</a></p>
  
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Multiple sclerosis</b> is a disease in which the myelin sheath of the neurons in the <b>brain</b> and <b>spinal cord</b> are damaged. The cause of this is unknown but many researchers are theorizing that it may be an <b>autoimmune disease</b>. </p>
  
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Note:</b> An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body.  </p>
  
  
      <img src="Images/multiple sclerosis.jpeg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Multiple Sclerosis" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="40" style="width: 50%;">
  
      <p class="w3-large">Others theorize it may be caused by <b>genetics</b> or <b>environmental factors</b> or from a <b>virus</b>. </p>
  
  
      <p class="w3-large">Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may include:<br><br>
      â¢ Problems controlling the body such as loss of coordination and balance<br>
      â¢ Changes in memory, concentration, reasoning, emotions or mood<br>
      â¢ Tiredness or insensitivity to heat
      </p>
  
  
      <p  class="w3-large">
        Overall, multiple sclerosis causes signals traveling through neurons to pass <b>slower</b> or <b>less smoothly</b>. Since the myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to be transmitted <b>quickly</b> and <b>efficiently</b>, the process of impulse flow is less effective compared to having <b>undamaged</b> myelin sheath. This can delay or affect signals and potentially leave the body with a <b>delayed/disrupted reaction</b>. Also, the myeline sheath protects the nerves from other electrical impulse, acting like an <b>insulating layer</b> on a cable. If it is damaged, electrical impulses could damage nerves as well. Therefore, multiple sclerosis affects the body's ability to maintain homeostasis due to delayed/disrupted messages which can affect bodily reactions and cause potential harm of nerves. This leaves the individual at risk and with an imbalance which could cause harm if untreated.
